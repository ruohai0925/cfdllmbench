# CFDLLMBench

**CFDLLMBench** is a comprehensive benchmark suite designed to assess Large Language Models (LLMs) on key competencies relevant to computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

![Benchmark Overview](../figs/main_figure_v6.png)

## :dart: Overview

CFDLLMBench evaluates LLMs across three interconnected tasks:

- :white_check_mark: **CFDQuery**: Conceptual understanding through multiple-choice CFD questions
- :white_check_mark: **CFDCodeBench**: Instruction-following ability to generate CFD code  
- :white_check_mark: **FoamBench**: End-to-end automation of OpenFOAM simulations from natural language

## :bulb: Motivation

While LLMs excel in general NLP, their ability to reason about scientific systems, generate structured physical code, and interface with domain-specific simulators like OpenFOAM remains underexplored.

**CFDLLMBench** bridges this gap by systematically measuring:

- Conceptual grasp of CFD principles (via QA)
- Structured code generation fidelity
- Robustness of simulation execution and output

## :rocket: Quick Start

Get started with CFDLLMBench in just a few steps:

1. **Installation**: Follow our [Getting Started Guide](getting-started.md)
2. **Run Benchmarks**: Execute the evaluation suite on your LLM
3. **Analyze Results**: Compare performance across all three tasks
